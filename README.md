# Music Information Retrieval
A collection of the projects I made about music information retrieval with their relative reports.

### Song Classification
In the song classification file an algorithm able to classify music according to its genre is created. The main idea is to analyse the rhythmic features of a certain piece with a machine learning algorithm that has been trained with the songs contained in the dataset called GTZAN, unanimously considered as the database-cornerstone of automatic genre classification.

### Source Separation
In the source separation file an algorithm able to separate the four voices of a chorale can be found. Nowadays, a task of this kind is solved by resorting to deep-learning architectures. What is done here is to find a solution to this problem the old-fashioned way adopting the Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) method.
